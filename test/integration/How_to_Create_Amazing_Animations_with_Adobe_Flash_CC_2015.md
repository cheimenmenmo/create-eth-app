## How to use the new bone tool for inverse kinematics (IK) animation
 
The bone tool is a new feature in Flash CC 2015 that allows you to create realistic and fluid animations of characters and objects with joints. You can use the bone tool to create a skeleton structure for your artwork, and then manipulate the bones to animate the movement of the limbs. The bone tool also supports IK animation, which means that you can control the position and orientation of a chain of bones by moving the end point of the chain.
 
To use the bone tool, follow these steps:

1. Create a new document in Flash CC 2015 and select a document type that supports IK animation, such as ActionScript 3.0 or HTML5 Canvas.
2. Import or draw your artwork on the stage. You can use any type of symbol or shape for your artwork, but make sure that each part of your character or object is on a separate layer.
3. Select the bone tool from the toolbar or press N on your keyboard.
4. Click on the first part of your artwork that you want to attach a bone to. A small circle will appear on the stage, indicating the root of your bone chain.
5. Drag from the circle to another part of your artwork that you want to connect with a bone. A line will appear between the two parts, representing a bone. A small square will appear at the end of the line, indicating a joint.
6. Repeat step 5 until you have created a complete skeleton structure for your artwork. You can create multiple bone chains for different parts of your artwork, such as arms, legs, head, etc.
7. To test your animation, select the selection tool from the toolbar or press V on your keyboard. Click and drag on any joint or end point of your bone chain to move it. You will see that the rest of the bones and artwork will follow accordingly.
8. To refine your animation, you can use the properties panel to adjust the settings of each bone, such as length, angle, rotation constraint, spring strength, damping strength, etc.

## How to import H.264 videos with audio
 
H.264 is a popular video format that offers high quality and compression efficiency. Flash CC 2015 allows you to import H.264 videos with audio into your document and use them as symbols or layers in your animation. You can also control the playback of your video with ActionScript or JavaScript code.
 
To import H.264 videos with audio, follow these steps:

1. Create a new document in Flash CC 2015 and select a document type that supports video import, such as ActionScript 3.0 or HTML5 Canvas.
2. Select File > Import > Import Video from the menu bar.
3. In the Import Video dialog box, browse for the H.264 video file that you want to import and click Open.
4. Select how you want to import your video: Embed FLV in SWF and play in timeline (for ActionScript 3.0 documents) or Place instance on stage (for HTML5 Canvas documents).
5. If you choose Embed FLV in SWF and play in timeline, 0f148eb4a0
