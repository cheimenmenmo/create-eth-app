## How to Master the FMX Trick System in Trials Fusion
  
Trials Fusion is not just about racing and completing tracks. It also has a new FMX Trick System that lets you perform amazing stunts and earn points. The FMX Trick System is based on using the right thumbstick to control your rider's body and bike. You can perform different tricks depending on the orientation of your bike and the direction of your thumbstick.
  
To master the FMX Trick System, you need to practice a lot and learn how to execute each trick correctly. You also need to know when to land and how to balance your bike after a trick. Here are some tips and tricks to help you become an FMX expert in Trials Fusion:

- Start with the FMX Training Program. This mode will teach you the basics of the FMX Trick System and let you practice in a wind tunnel. You can also see a list of all the tricks and their inputs in this mode.
- Use the right bike for the right track. Some bikes are better suited for FMX than others. For example, the Pit Viper is agile and responsive, while the Roach is more stable and durable. Experiment with different bikes and see which one works best for you.
- Plan your tricks ahead. Don't just randomly move the thumbstick and hope for the best. Look at the track layout and see where you can perform tricks and where you need to be careful. Try to chain multiple tricks together for more points and combos.
- Land smoothly and safely. After performing a trick, you need to land on your wheels and keep your balance. Otherwise, you will crash and lose points. To land smoothly, try to align your bike with the slope of the landing zone and release the thumbstick before you touch the ground.
- Watch other players' replays. You can learn a lot from watching how other players perform tricks and complete tracks. You can access other players' replays from the leaderboards or from the track selection screen. Pay attention to their timing, inputs, and landing techniques.

Trials Fusion is a game that rewards skill and creativity. The FMX Trick System adds a new dimension of fun and challenge to the game. With practice and patience, you can master it and impress your friends with your stunts.
